# THE-PiPDT
The Helpful Engineer's Pi Power Developer Tips

Tips and Tricks for the power developer for the Raspberry Pi and other small SBC's. Some are code ideas, others are process ideas, others are simply bad ideas. (But hopefully not!)

* [#1 - Pi Notes](001-Pi-Notes): Keep your dev notes with the &micro;SD card you're working on
* (Next up) #2 - Pi IP Announcer: A headless helper for easily announcing the Pi's IP address

Down in the stack... somewhere:
* IP assignment
* Make your own Raspbian image.
* The &micro;SD card write dilemna.
* Creating a WiFi access point
